I am an Associate Professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (Brest, France), member of the [BRAIN](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/recherche-innovation/equipe/brain) research team within the [Lab-STICC](https://labsticc.fr/) laboratory (CNRS UMR 6285).

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, and **Signal Processing**, with applications in healthcare. I focus on both fundamental aspects of models and their application to clinical usecases.

## Research Interests

- **Few-Shot Learning & Frugal AI** — Learning with limited labeled data, diversity-driven approaches
- **Foundation Models** — Large-scale pre-trained models for EEG, language, and multimodal data
- **AI for Healthcare** — Cardiology, neurology, oncology — multimodal medical data integration
- **Graph Signal Processing** — Signal analysis on irregular domains, neuroimaging applications
