I am an Associate Professor at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/) (Brest, France), member of the [BRAIN](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr/recherche-innovation/equipe/brain) research team within the [Lab-STICC](https://labsticc.fr/) laboratory (CNRS UMR 6285).

My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, and **Signal Processing**, with applications in healthcare. I focus on both fundamental aspects of models and their application to clinical usecases.

→ See the [Research page](/research) for publications, projects, and supervised students.

I am involved in numerous teaching activities at IMT Atlantique, including courses on machine learning, deep learning, algorithms, and critical thinking. I am also the co-leader of the Data Science track, and co-leader of Computer Science courses for first year engineering students.
